									<p>
										I am Sowkat Alam, a young and passionate Full Stack Software Engineer looking to change the world through the use of technology. I strive in achieving a positive impact on any company or product I am working on.
										<br><br>
										I have 3+ years of experience in full-stack software development, 4+ years of experience in competitive programming, and 2 years of experience as a research and teaching assistant. I completed my master's degree from the University of Lethbridge. As a software engineer, I developed strong problem-solving and communication skills. During that period, I used to manage USA-based clients that provide solutions for Pharma/Biotech manufacturers. I mainly developed various kinds of desktop and web-based applications and maintained multiple large-scale databases for those applications. I worked on code quality and code complexity during my master's degree program. As a graduate teaching assistant, I used to take labs and classes on Fundamentals of Programming Concepts and Object-Oriented Programming. Besides, I used to review students’ programs and mark their assignments.

												Computer Program Complexity and Its Correlation with Program Features and Sociolinguistics.
											</h5>
											<h6 >
												M.Sc. in Computer Science Thesis Work (2018-2020)
											</h6>
											<h6>
												<b>Supervisor:</b> Professor Dr. Jackie Rice
											</h6>

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> The use of natural language among humans depends on factors such as social status, economic status, gender, age, and region. These factors may also impact the use of programming languages. This research focuses on the influence of socio-characteristics, especially region and gender, on the use of programming languages. A set of programming features was used in machine learning experiments to determine whether there are any similarities in the use of C++ programming language based on the programmer's region or gender. Frequency analysis was previously carried out to identify any gender-based differences in how features were used by the authors. We performed a similar type of analysis to determine which features are more or less likely to be used in the programs from a particular region or written by a particular gender. We also explored programming complexity based on a previous work where researchers described a software readability model that included programming features such as keywords and operators. Those features were found to be strongly correlated with three software quality measures: software defect log messages, automated defect reports, and code change. In our work, two types of complexity metrics were used to determine a correlation between programming features and complexity features. Our goal is to determine whether these features may make computer programs easier or harder to read, or more or less complex (and hence more or less prone to bugs).

												RoleRecommender: A Recommendation System that recommends commenter role (developer, tester/QA) based on Bug Report Comments.
											</h5>
											<h6 >
												M.Sc. in Computer Science Project Work (2018)
											</h6>
											<h6>
												<b>Supervisor:</b> Assistant Professor Dr. John Anvik
											</h6>

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> Analysis of bug reports and bug report comments largely depends on many machine learning techniques. This paper focuses on those machine learning techniques for recommending commenter role by analyzing bug reports comments. My main goal was to create a recommendation system that can recommend whether a commenter is a developer or tester. Finding a commenter role is very important as it will help design role-specific IDEs, detect plagiarism, and improve communication between developers and testers. In this work, I used Mozilla bug report comments as the data set. These comments were written using plain text. I extracted the features from those comments. Then, I used a classifier for training and testing purposes. I divided the data set into two parts. I trained the classifier with one part. Then, I evaluated the performance of the recommender system by testing with another part. I also performed a random role recommendation approach where I randomly selected the commenter role. After that, I evaluated the performance of the random role recommendation approach. Finally, I compared the performance of the random role recommendation approach and the recommendation system. The results of various experiments are very promising. The results showed that the recommendation system achieved precision of 87.5%, recall of 77.78%, and F-measure of 82.35%, whereas the random role recommendation approach was able to achieve precision of 57.14%, recall of 44.44%, and F-measure of 50.0%. Therefore, the recommendation system outperforms the random role recommendation approach by improving the precision by 30.36%, recall by 32.74%, and F-measure by 32.35%.

												Finding a suitable classifier from six different classifiers (supervised learning).

												<b>Supervisor:</b> Assistant Professor Md. Hafizur Rahman

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> This project focused on the selection of a suitable classifier from six different classifiers for a dataset. I used machine learning tool Weka for applying Naïve Bayes, Logistic, KNN, Decision Table, Entropy Based Decision Tree (J48), and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers. The main idea was to find the accuracy and confusion matrix of those classifiers for that dataset. Then I used ROC graph to plot those value and select the suitable classifier.

												Location Based restaurant finder and Rating System

											<h6>
												<b>Supervisor:</b>
												Assistant Professor MOHAMMAD SAMAWAT ULLAH
											</h6>

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> Similar to Uber Eats and SkipTheDishes, I tried to build a website where anyone can search restaurants in a particular area. It is not a food ordering website but a restaurant finder and rating system. Users can search restaurants by location in the website's search bar. It will return a list of restaurants in that location. If users select a restaurant from the list, they can see individual restaurant pages, menu, google map location, special offer, and restaurant rating. Similar to google rating, users can also give a rating to the restaurant. In addition, they can update their old rating as well. The website has three different kinds of users (customer or guest, restaurant, and admin). Multilevel protection and transactions were added to support all types of users. The website's location-based search works for nearby places too. There is an admin who can review all users.

												A Semantic Approach to Object Detection Algorithm Selection
											</h5>
											<h6 >
												B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering Thesis Work (2016-2017)
											</h6>
											<h6>
												<b>Supervisor:</b> Associate Professor Dr. Khandaker Tabin Hasan
											</h6>

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> This research focused on the selection of image detection algorithms following the semantic approach. Finding algorithms is very hard when anyone tries to detect an object from an image. Though there are many object detection algorithms, there is no such way to find out which algorithm will give better results without running them all one by one which is very time-consuming. We proposed an idea by which we can select the most suitable image detection algorithm following the semantic approach. A lexical database “WordNet” was used to differentiate the type of object we are dealing with. Then we developed a hierarchical tree where, an object, particularly a “noun” can be fit into. We computed the most occurring “sense” among all the “senses” to place a noun in the tree node. After placing an object in its appropriate node, we can find out the algorithm that suits best for detecting similar types of objects. Four different image detection algorithms, WordNet python API, and OpenCv were used for grouping words and running algorithms on images.

												Suggesting a healthy diet containing balanced nutrient value for breakfast.

												<b>Supervisor:</b>
												Assistant Professor Md. Hafizur Rahman

											<p>
												<b >Overview:</b> This project focused on the suggestion of a healthy diet containing balanced nutrient value for breakfast. The data set contained nutritional information for 77 different breakfast cereals. After analyzing this data set there was a clear concept about different nutrition that belongs to different cereals. And there were some parameters which helped to distinguish that which food to take and which food to avoid for a particular health condition. I used machine learning tool weka for Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Data Visualization, and Co-Relation.
